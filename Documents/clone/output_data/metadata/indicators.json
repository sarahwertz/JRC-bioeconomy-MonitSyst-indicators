Agricultural factor income measures the income generated by farming, which is used to remunerate borrowed or rented factors of production (capital, wages and land rents) as well as own production factors (own labour, capital and land). Factor income corresponds to the deflated (real) net value added at factor cost of agriculture. The implicit price index of GDP is used as deflator. Annual work units (AWUs) are defined as full-time equivalent employment (corresponding to the number of full-time equivalent jobs), i.e. as total hours worked divided by the average annual number of hours worked in full-time jobs within the economic territory",

The supply data are based on the food balance sheets (FBS) available at FAOSTAT. Data sources are primarily FAO questionnaires, national publications available in the ESS Library and Country visits by statisticians involving discussions with national experts. The food balance sheet shows the availability for human consumption for each food item i.e. each primary commodity, which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of all foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period, gives the supply available during that period. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products. The data for this indicator can also be expressed in terms of its energy value. ",

The indicator shows the abundance and diversity of a selection of common bird species and is presented as Index 2000 = 100 and Index 1990 = 100. Three groups of bird species are represented: common farmland species (39 species), common forest species (34 species), all common bird species (167 species) which include the farmland species, the forest species and a further 94 common species (generalists, as opposed to the farmland and forest specialists). Rare species are excluded, although some species common in certain Member States may be considered rare in others. The species covered under the common farmland and common forest indices are deemed to be dependent on that particular kind of habitat for feeding and nesting. Each of the three indices is a composite, multispecies index calculated using Monte Carlo simulations as described in Soldaat et al. (2017) and an R-script developed by Statistics Netherlands. The indices are presented for EU-aggregates only and with smoothed values. The indices draw from data produced by the European Bird Census Council and its Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme programme. The data source comprises EBCC/RSPB/BirdLife/Czech Society for Ornithology.

The overall material use is measured by summing up the aggregate domestic material consumption (DMC) and the circular use of materials. DMC is defined in economy-wide material flow accounts. The circular use of materials is approximated by the amount of waste recycled in domestic recovery plants minus imported waste destined for recovery plus exported waste destined for recovery abroad. Waste recycled in domestic recovery plants comprises the recovery operations R2 to R11 - as defined in the Waste Framework Directive 75/442/EEC. The imports and exports of waste destined for recycling - i.e. the amount of imported and exported waste bound for recovery – are approximated from the European statistics on international trade in goods. A higher circularity rate value indicates means that more secondary materials substitute for primary raw materials thus reducing the environmental impacts of extracting primary material. ",
